# android-capstone-project

Final project for Udacity's Android Developer course.

This app uses Google Translate. As Google Translate is a paid service, an api key is needed to run the app. Define this in your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties:

AndroidTranslateApiKey=<api_key_for_app>
ServerTranslateApiKey=<api_key_for_robolectric_tests>
